\section*{Acknowledgements} \label{sec:acknowledgements}
    I would like to thank Dr. Shi for approving this project, as it has been a question I have held for a long time though likely never would have developed without some incentive. Additionally, we very much appreciate the criticisms and suggestions made by our peer editors: Christopher Taylor, Yasif Rahman, and Angel Bojorge. Finally, we would like to thank the physics department here at USF, for fostering knowledge and challenging students to learn and achieve (and especially for the experience in utilization of LaTeX for future work in the STEM fields).
