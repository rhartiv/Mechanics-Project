\begin{abstract}
Here we consider a problem which occurs in everyday life, relating to the challenges of our current situation in that here in Spring 2020, we would like to remain distant from one another to keep from the spread of COVID-19. We develop a number of mathematical formalisms for tackling the problem and allow for a number of specific cases in which they apply. We further model computationally our developments under ideal conditions, and then show that they are consistent with experiment. And lastly, we answer the question posed in the title.
